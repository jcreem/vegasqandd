Some quick and dirty purpose built script for Vegas Pro (formerly Sony Vegas Pro, now Magix Vegas Pro

These are not really intended to be useful for anyone else - several times throughout the years I've needed
to put together a script for helping with a specific Vegas video editing project. Genrally I've done these without
GUIs or even parameters - just hard coded for some need to solve an immediate itch on a project. While
these are meant to be throw away, I do this infrequently enough that it has been a pain to
recreate even the basic structure when I needed something so I figured
I'd just start storing these.
